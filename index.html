                        <p>
                            My name is Logan Tyler, and I'm a Full-Stack Developer currently in Cameron Park, California. I love spending time with my family,
                            biking, and gaming with my friends. Family time is and will always be my number one priority. When in a working environment, I peform well 
                            working both in a team and independently. I am also detail oriented and incorporate that into my work wherever possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I graduated from the Neumont College of Computer Science in 2021 and have since worked for a number of companies. I am most comfortable working in 
                            HTML/CSS/JavaScript, though I am also comfortable working with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks, most notably AngularJS and ReactJS. I have worked with other languages like Python, Ruby, C#, and Java, 
                            though I'm not as proficient with those as I am with JavaScript. My most recent position was as a Cloud Native Developer with Redstone Content Solutions. Unfortunately, I was let go due to a reduction in Redstone's workforce. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My current short-term goal is to expand my skillset. As mentioned before, I'm not as proficient with some other languages as JavaScript. Expanding my skillset to learn more about those languages, as well as 
                            other languages, frameworks, libraries, etc., both new and old, can only benefit me. My long term goal is to find a position that I am comfortable working in. My ideal position is not one in higher management, but one where 
                            I can continue coding and problem solving. My ideal company is one who respects their employees and has a good work/life balance.
