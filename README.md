# Logan Tyler's Portfolio Site

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and can be viewed [here](https://logantyl.github.io/).

This site was built in order to have a proper site to express myself and my work. As I work on more projects in my career, whether personal or professional, my goal is to add them here to showcase for others to see.

The page is still currently in a Work In Progress state, but I would like to get it in a presentable state ASAP in order to work on other projects and practice some old and new skills.
